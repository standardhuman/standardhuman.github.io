        ...and this is my (long) backstory.
        I've been a sailor, an educator, a runner, and a compulsive habit maker. In 2015 I decided I wanted to learn programming. So I set about the task of learning everything I could about making these machines go beep.
        <br />
        From Free Code Camp to various Codecademy courses, I gobbled up the resources. Next came programming meetups. One day I learned about the Telegraph Academy prep course, which was like night school for web development. For 6 weeks, 4 nights a week I learned how to use JavaScript. When I finished, I came back as a teaching assistant to help the new cohort of students because there is nothing — absolutely nothing — half so much worth doing as helping others find their way to their own "ah-ha!" moments.
        <br />
        And of course, I learned mountains of goodness in the process. It’s unavoidable! I love this process so much I started my own teaching experiment. My mission: find a few students who were new to programming that wanted to spend some time learning with me. I would design and build out the daily curriculum and jump in to help get them unstuck as needed. It would be remote, free, and, for me, still deeply afflicted with imposter syndrome, totally terrifying. With the gentle encouragement and guidance of one remarkable friend, it became all of these things. But it also became relentlessly satisfying. For 30 days I led a group of 4-6 students through a crash course in computer science and javascript programming. It was called the <a href="https://github.com/CirrusCollective/home">Cirrus Collective</a>. Looking back now I don’t know how I did it, but I do know why.
        <br />
        Several months ago, that same remarkable friend connected me with <a href="https://github.com/tandcsurf">Larry Stiers</a>. Larry was at a similar point in his coding journey and was as willing to throw as many hours at this process as I was. Soon, Larry and I were stumbling, hacking, and bashing (our heads against the wall) together for hours everyday. Day in and day out since August ’16 we would put in 6-10 hour days.
        <br />
        We’ve learned about <span class="skill">data structures</span>. We’ve crunched loads of algorithms. We’ve learned about <span class="skill">HTTP</span> requests and encodings and we’ve built servers to handle them using <span class="skill">Node</span> and <span class="skill">Express</span>. We learned more <span class="skill">JavaScript</span > and implemented frameworks like
        <a href="https://standardhuman.github.io/positivebalance/jquery/"><span class="skill">jQuery</span>,</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/standardhuman/positivebalance/tree/master/angular"><span class="skill">Angular</span></a>,
        <a href="href=https://github.com/standardhuman/positivebalance/react"> <span class="skill">React</span></a> and are currently chowing down on <span class="skill">React Native</span>. [Sources here, but please avert your eyes from these abominations].
        <br />
        We’ve built out backends with <span class="skill">Node</span> and <span class="skill">Postgres</span>, and really like back-end as a service options like Firebase. We are writing tidier, more potent code with <span class="skill">ES6</span>. We’re making prettier UIs faster and easier with <span class="skill">Flexbox</span>. We’ve learned how to speed things up by decluttering the <span class="skill">critical rendering path</span>. We’ve learned to better manage our versioning messes via <span class="skill">git</span> and <span class="skill">GitHub</span>. We’ve made our homes at the command line and <span class="skill">MDN</span> and <span class="skill">Stack Overflow</span> and in <span class="skill">Atom</span> and <span class="skill">Chrome dev tools</span>. We’ve learned a lot about autonomy and how to build software and how to <span class="skill">work remotely</span> with someone we’ve never met, because Larry lives in Brooklyn and I in the SF Bay Area.
        <br />
        But mostly we’ve learned a lot about <span class="skill">how to learn</span>.
